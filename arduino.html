<h1>ARDUINO</h1>

<p>So, what is an Arduino?</p>
<p>Arduino is a company that produces a microcontroller of the same name, which supports C and C+ as programming languages.</p>
<h2>Tug of War</h2>

<p>Our project is fairly basic, as me and my partner, Alec, are very inexperienced with the Arduino and C++. We made a simple tug of war game,
which had 9 LEDs, and two buttons. A single LED in the center would light up, and would be sent back and forth depending on how fast each player
could mash the button. Whoever got the LED to the other side of the field would be the winner, playing a little tune, and resetting the game. 
A gif of the setup is below, along with explanations.

  <li>Parts used:</li> 
<li>1) Buzzer (can make noise)</li>
<li>9) LEDS (can light up)</li>
<li>2) Buttons (can be pressed)</li>
<li>17) Wires (connects inputs and outputs)</li>
<li>11) Resistors (lowers electrical current)</li>
<!--</ul>-->

<br>Wires and resistors are used throughout the project to connect them to inputs on the Arduino.(The green board) 
<br>Wires connect buttons and leds to pins on the Arduino, allowing them to interact with code that we run. The LEDS represent the position of
<br>the center of the "rope". Each button press moves the light closer to whichever player tapped the button. Winning basically comes down to 
<br>button mashing and endurance. When someone wins, their side lights up, playing a classic tune. The end of this song resets the game, signalling a new round.

<br> A challenge we had while developing this project was coming up with an idea that could fit with the constraints of the Arduino. First, is that 
<br> we were working with limited space. The space we had to work with was a 10 x 30 unit grid, which is fairly small. We were also 
<br> limited by how powering a horizontal space powered all horizontal spaces within that column. There were also only 13 different pins that
<br> we could control via C++. This forced us to try and find a project that worked within our limitations, such as only requiring less than or 
<br> exactl 13 pins, and also only needing a vertical line display or similar.
