<h1>VINDINIUM</h1>

<p><i>Four legendary heroes were fighting for the land of Vindinium
<br>Making their way in the dangerous woods
<br>Slashing goblins and stealing gold mines
<br>And looking for a tavern where to drink their gold</i></p>
<img src="vind.png"></img>
<p>So, what is Vindinium?</p>
<p>Vindinium is a game up to four players battle it out to take mines and end up with the most amount of gold. 
They can go to taverns to heal, attack other players, or most importantly, capture mines. The catch is in 
how you control the bots. Rather than directly controlling them, you must program an AI in any programming
language you prefer. The intelligence of these bots varies from the most basic level of taking the most 
direct path to a mine regardless of the obstacles, or to using complex pathing systems that calculate the 
cost and risk of moving to an area.
<br> Everyone also has 100 health, loses 20 health from players and goblins, and can heal for 50 health at taverns.
Additionally, if you die, you lose all your mines to your killer, but keep any gold you've accumulated. Mines are the 
source of gold, giving out 1 gold per mine every turn.
</p>

<h2>My Bot</h2>

<p>My program is fairly basic, not able to make complex decisions. And it shows: My elo is 1300 versus the lowest
score currently on vindinium, at 1900. This is to be expected, as my programming capabilities are fairly limited.
However, I can at least explain some of the code and thinking behind it.</p>

<pre><code>       
        //if my health is too low go heal
        if(bot.yourBot.life<=55){
        task = "happyhour";            
        }
        //if there are still many mines to be claimed then claim more
        else if(totalNumMines - bot.freeMines.length > bot.yourBot.mineCount + totalNumMines/2){
        task = "claimMines";
        }
        //if richest enemy has more mines than me and less health    
        else if(bot.data.game.turn >= 100 && richestEnemyMineCount > bot.yourBot.mineCount && richestEnemy.life + 20 < bot.yourBot.life){
        //go hunt the rich
        task = "hunt";
        }
        //if nothing else, get a small loan of a million dollars
        else{
        task = "claimMines";    
        }
        </code></pre>
<p> Here is a snippet of my code. My bot prioritizes staying alive over all else, so that it won't die to other bots and lose all its gold.
